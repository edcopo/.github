# Edcopo

**Edcopo** is an open-source tool designed to help developers and educators automate the process of extracting technical knowledge from code repositories, generating educational content, and porting code to Rust. The goal is to make it easier to understand, learn from, and migrate complex codebases through AI-powered insights and gamified learning experiences.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Code Analysis**: Automatically extract and analyze technical information from any code repository, including architecture, dependencies, and algorithms.
- **Educational Content Creation**: Generate tutorials, documentation, and walkthroughs based on the code structure and functionality.
- **Game-Like Visualization**: Represent codebases as interactive game objects for intuitive exploration and learning.
- **Automated Rust Porting**: Port code from multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++) to Rust, focusing on memory safety and concurrency.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Contribute to the project, improve features, and help make Edcopo the go-to tool for codebase education.

## üì• Getting Started

To get started with **Edcopo**, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up **Edcopo**, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for running the educational content generation server)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (for the Rust porting tool)
- Python (optional, if you plan to contribute to the AI code analysis part)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/edcopo.git
   cd edcopo
   ```

2. Install dependencies (for the educational content server):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Rust (if not already installed):

   Follow the instructions at [Rust Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

4. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run the project:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you should be able to open the project in your browser and start exploring how Edcopo generates educational content from code!

## üí° How It Works

Edcopo‚Äôs core functionality revolves around analyzing code and converting it into learning materials. Here‚Äôs an overview of how the tool works:

1. **Code Analysis**: Edcopo extracts key technical information from a code repository, such as functions, classes, and their interactions.
2. **Educational Content Generation**: Based on the analysis, Edcopo creates:
   - Code summaries and explanations
   - Visual representations (e.g., flowcharts, graphs)
   - Detailed tutorials or interactive walkthroughs
3. **Game-Like Representation**: You can explore the codebase as if it were a game world. Classes and modules are represented as "game objects" that you can "enter" to explore their functionality.
4. **Rust Porting**: Once you‚Äôve explored the codebase, Edcopo can help you port it to Rust. The tool automatically handles language translation, memory safety checks, and concurrency modeling.

## üåê Community & Contribution

We welcome contributions from developers, educators, and enthusiasts! Whether you're interested in improving the code analysis algorithm, adding new educational content features, or extending the Rust porting capabilities, your help is appreciated.
