# Edcopo

**Edcopo** is an open-source tool designed to help developers and educators automate the process of extracting technical knowledge from code repositories, generating educational content, and porting code to Rust. The goal is to make it easier to understand, learn from, and migrate complex codebases through AI-powered insights and gamified learning experiences.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Code Analysis**: Automatically extract and analyze technical information from any code repository, including architecture, dependencies, and algorithms.
- **Educational Content Creation**: Generate tutorials, documentation, and walkthroughs based on the code structure and functionality.
- **Game-Like Visualization**: Represent codebases as interactive game objects for intuitive exploration and learning.
- **Automated Rust Porting**: Port code from multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++) to Rust, focusing on memory safety and concurrency.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Contribute to the project, improve features, and help make Edcopo the go-to tool for codebase education.


## üí° How It Works

Edcopo‚Äôs core functionality revolves around analyzing code and converting it into learning materials. Here‚Äôs an overview of how the tool works:

1. **Code Analysis**: Edcopo extracts key technical information from a code repository, such as functions, classes, and their interactions.
2. **Educational Content Generation**: Based on the analysis, Edcopo creates:
   - Code summaries and explanations
   - Visual representations (e.g., flowcharts, graphs)
   - Detailed tutorials or interactive walkthroughs
3. **Game-Like Representation**: You can explore the codebase as if it were a game world. Classes and modules are represented as "game objects" that you can "enter" to explore their functionality.
4. **Rust Porting**: Once you‚Äôve explored the codebase, Edcopo can help you port it to Rust. The tool automatically handles language translation, memory safety checks, and concurrency modeling.

## üåê Community & Contribution

We welcome contributions from developers, educators, and enthusiasts! Whether you're interested in improving the code analysis algorithm, adding new educational content features, or extending the Rust porting capabilities, your help is appreciated.
